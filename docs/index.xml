I can pick up 97.1 FM on my home SDR setup, but there is not any current FM listening post nearby in its range. If you are looking for Tigers baseball and don&amp;rsquo;t have a hardware radio, try WTKA 1050 Ann Arbor.</description>

      <description>The nearby cafe to the house. Not a ton of seating, and the prices are a little on the high side. But you can&amp;rsquo;t argue with the location.
There&amp;rsquo;s pricey gelato here too, and they serve an affogato.
My biggest beef with them is that the counter sometimes forgets part of an order.</description>

This was widely interpreted by the tech press as a challenge to Qualcomm, whose parternship with Microsoft includes a just-in-time compiler for x86 capable of running Intel-based Microsoft Windows user code at full speed.

      <description>A case and network fabric suitable for building a computing cluster out of these MACCHIATObin boards was announced at launch time by PicoCluster, which also makes cluster cases for Raspberry Pi. The enclosure, which features space for six of these compute boards, is sold in a variety of configurations depending if you need just the case or if you are also buying the compute boards and network gear.
&amp;ldquo;Shipping is expected to occur by the end of September 2017 subject to board and switch availability.</description>

      <description>Marvell has announced its MACCHIATObin community development board. This device, in a convenient mini-ITX form factor, features a Marvell ARMADA 8040 SoC with four Cortex-A72 ARMv8 processors. It sports an impressive array of I/O channels including two 10G Ethernet interfaces, three SATA 3.0 interfaces, and up to 16G of memory. This ships at prices starting at $349. Solid Run is the manufacturer.
CNXSoft has an active discussion about this board, including reports from someone who had their device shipped in May 2017.</description>

      <description>Minio is a distributed storage system that provides a familiar Amazon S3 based programming interface but that runs on your own systems. The folks at Minio have spent considerable effort working on performance by embedding Intel and ARM assembly language routines to take advantage of vector and matrix operations on both platforms.
Frank Wessels from Minio presented a talk on High performance scaling techniques in Golang using Go Assembly, at the FOSDEM 17 conference in Brussels in February 2017.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Momentum is Building for ARM in HPC&amp;rdquo; is an article in The Next Platform by Jonathan Beard and Roxana Rusitoru of ARM Holdings chronicling the GoingARM workshop at the recent ISC conference on high-performance computing in Frankfurt, Germany.
https://www.nextplatform.com/2017/06/30/momentum-building-arm-hpc/
 From looking around the room, it was clear the workshop was significantly more popular than expected. During the entire day, there was standing room only, having throughout the day approximately 70 attendees.</description>

      <description>Alpine is a frequent choice for Docker projects because of its compact packaging which results in remarkably small Docker images. As of this writing, the new Alpine release has not yet been picked up by Docker for their popular aarch64/alpine container. This is because Docker reorganized their container support on DockerHub to use new names, making the it now arm64v8/alpine.
The new naming scheme is unique to Docker, and allows them to distinguish between the various 32-bit ARM variants that have distinctly different container support, e.</description>

      <description>Andreas Färber has an hour-long presentation on OpenSUSE on ARM hardware, in which he details the state of OpenSUSE on a whole series of ARM development boards. The talk was presented at the openSUSE Conference 2017 and published on May 27, 2017. Andreas notes that this is &amp;ldquo;not a hardware selection guide&amp;rdquo;, and recommends that if you want ARM hardware recommendations that you consult the opensuse-arm mailing list instead.
Andreas&amp;rsquo;s hard work and others have resulted in OpenSUSE for a number of systems, with more in progress, tracked on their development wiki.</description>

The system was demonstrated running Windows applications in an emulation mode, and the report from Tom&amp;rsquo;s Hardware of that demo talks of multiple Office documents, video, and email running with no visible delays or hiccups.
Demos of the system have been out long out for the tech press to start to speculate about how this system will fit into the Windows ecosystem.</description>

      <description>LinuxGizmos.com reports on a development board from Intrinsyc, the Open-Q 835, which features Qualcomm&amp;rsquo;s 8-core Snapdragon 835 SoC. The dev board is in a Mini-ITX form factor and it provides access to the 835&amp;rsquo;s many functions including 4K HDMI video, dual cameras, GPS, Bluetooth and BLE, and more.
The device runs Android 7 &amp;ldquo;Nougat&amp;rdquo; with a reference to &amp;ldquo;contact sales for Windows 10&amp;rdquo; support. At a pricetag of $1,149 for the early adopter version, it is perhaps most suited to go into the hands of mobile phone engineers who are looking to incorporate the Snapdragon 835 into their designs.</description>

      <description>Wireguard is virtual private network software with a novel design that puts most of the work into the Linux kernel. It makes use of familiar Unix networking primitives to control routing and filtering of packets, allowing the system manager to compose a VPN out of components that can each independently be audited for correctness.
The most recent development snapshot of Wireguard, 0.0.20170531, includes a set of ARM assembly instructions that speed up cryptographic operations on ARM NEON capable processors.</description>

      <title>pigz, a fast parallel version of gzip</title>

      <description>pigz is a &amp;ldquo;parallel implementation of gzip for modern multi-processor, multi-core machines&amp;rdquo;. By breaking your compression problem into pieces and then doing each piece individually, pigz effectively uses as much of your machine as you will let it to compress data quickly.
A sample will illustrate. On a 123 megabyte file (the source code for PostgreSQL), standard gzip took 18.4 seconds to compress a tar file on the 96-core Type 2A ARMv8 machine at Packet.</description>
