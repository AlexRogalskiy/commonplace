title: Dijkstra's algorithm
---
Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path from one node in a weighted
digraph to all other reachable nodes in that digraph. It uses a greedy
breadth-first search to accomplish this task.

The algorithm is something of a computer science shibboleth; if you have
a degree in CS, you should be able to implement this on the spot, or
at least describe how it works on the white board.
