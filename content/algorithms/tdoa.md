title: TDoA (Time Delay of Arrival)
---
Localize a signal by measuring delay from multiple
locations. Also known as MLAT (multilateralization).

Some examples come from
[the TDoA section of the RTL-SDR weblog](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/tag/tdoa/),
where various software-defined radio implementations
are used for signal location of unknown transmitters,
ranging from pirate radio stations to aircraft.
