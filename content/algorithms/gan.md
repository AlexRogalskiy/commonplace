title: GAN (generative adversarial network)
---
> We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via an adversarial process, 
in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative model G that captures 
the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates the 
probability that a sample came from the training data rather than G. 
The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. 
This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game.
