title: Fast and Frugal
---
Fast and Frugal decision trees have the characteristic
that at every stage of the decision tree, a choice is
made. This "heuristic" approach allows for very compact,
easy to understand decision making processes within
the grasp of unaided humans to execute, and with results
that are surprisingly powerful especially in the presence
of bounds on search time and costs of decision making.

Some code in R computes trees based on training data
and presents measures of quality:
