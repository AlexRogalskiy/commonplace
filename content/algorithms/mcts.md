title: MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search)
---

Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a method for making optimal decisions in
artificial intelligence (AI) problems, typically move planning in combinatorial 
games. It combines the generality of random simulation with the precision of tree search.

MCTS was introduced in 2006 as an algorithm for playing the game of Go,
which had been resistant to attack by other methods.
