title: Levenshtein distance
---
> The Levenshtein distance between two strings is the number of
single character deletions, insertions, or substitutions required
to transform one string into the other. This is also known as the
edit distance.

Analysis of this algorithm can be found at the
[Mathworks blog](https://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/2017/08/14/levenshtein-edit-distance-between-strings/)
and at [NIST](https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/Levenshtein.html).
