title: Tampa Bay Rays
---
The Tampa Bay Rays flagship station is 620 [WDAE] in St Petersburg,
Florida.

WDAE's signal is too weak by the time it gets south to Miami or Key
West to make it over the stronger Cuban station Radio Rebelde (though
you can hear the unmistakable sounds of baseball underneath), but the
KiwiSDR in Tampa at [KF4LIJ] will pull the station in just fine.

A map of the [Rays Radio Network] might suggest some alternatives, such
as [WJBX] 770 Fort Meyers, or perhaps [WKII] 1070 Port Charlotte or even
[WORL] 950 Orlando.
