title: Writer’s block

I’m working on an assignment and I’m stuck. This is an attempt to
get unstuck.

The hardest part for me of working on assignments for someone else
is the concern (justified or not) that the editor who is getting
my work is going to be disappointed by it. I know that from past
experience that’s unlikely to happen on this particular gig – not
that they won’t see something to fix, but as long as it’s turned
in on time and is the right shape and size I’ve had pretty good
luck with getting the work approved.

It’s very different writing for someone else than it is for myself.
Blogging has its own trials and travails, but pleasing an editor
is not one of them. Rather, there’s a terrifying time when you hit
“publish” and the world either sees your headline and says “meh”
or they pick it up and share it with their friends.

Ultimately, most of my writing is for the world or for myself. I’ve
written here before about keeping an open notebook and what that
means for my tolerance for the incomplete image in my own writing.
But when you’re writing for someone else the whole package really
wants to be neat and tidy and polished, and that brings with it a
separate set of expectations.
