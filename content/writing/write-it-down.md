title: Write it down
---
When you successfully do something modestly complex,
you should write down what you did and share it.
This way the future you will have some inkling of what you
were thinking at the time so that they have some hope of fixing it when it breaks.

This is doubly true for home and hobby projects where
you might really never notice downtime until much later
than the actual failure.
