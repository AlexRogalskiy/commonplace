title: Fill the input box
---
Figure out the size of the input box, and fill it up so that
everything you type fits neatly without scrolling.

If your email client gives you ten lines to type your message, type
ten (and not two or twenty). If letters to the editor have to be
less than 500 words, never write 600 words. If you old cell phone
has a tiny screen, abbrev your memos to self.

This principle works just as well for paper. I am a recent convert
from quadrille ruled 8.5x11" lab notebooks to a quad ruled pocket
Field Notes notebook. It's so much easier to fill up a page with one
thought when the page only fits five long sentences.

The input box for the wiki where I first wrote this down
is smaller than this 80x24 terminal screen, I'm writing a little less.
It's a cheat to change fonts or page widths from the defaults.
