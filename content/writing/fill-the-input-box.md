title: Fill the input box
---
This is a strategy for coming up with the right size of a contribution
to some kind of online system. Figure out what the size of the input
box is, and then fill it up with what you have to say so that
everything you type fits without scrolling.

If your email client gives you ten lines to type your message, type
ten (and not two or twenty). If letters to the editor have to be
less than 500 words, never make it 600. If you crummy old cell phone
has a tiny screen, learn to abbrev your memos to self.

This principle works as well for paper input methods. I am a recent
convert from quadrille ruled 8.5x11" lab notebooks to a quad ruled
pocket Moleskine notebook; it's so much easier to fill up a page
with one thought when the page only fits five long sentences vs.
five long paragraphs.

The input box for the Vacuum wiki where I first wrote "Fill the
input box without scrolling" is somewhat smaller than the Ecto input
box, so I'm writing a little more - but not much. It's a cheat to
change fonts or page widths from the defaults, but I did slide the
slider between first-page and following page for this one.
