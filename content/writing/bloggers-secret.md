title: The Blogger's Secret
---
The Blogger's Secret is a method and a system for developing and
sharpening your expertise on a specific topic.  It can be expressed
very simply:

> Write about a topic twice a day for six months and you will be
recognized as an expert in that field.

Hidden inside this simple method is a system for making it possible
to sustain this output and to weave a set of connections (in your
work and in the world) that go beyond a simple cut and paste of
other people's words and ideas.

--

This site puts these ideas into practice.
It's a demonstration of systematic and deliberate efforts to
write with authority while still learning what there is to learn.

You can become expert simply by being
persistent and methodical and public in your efforts to learn.
Your site constructed
for this purpose cannot be about anything and everything that comes
to mind; as soon as someone describes it as eclectic or has a hard
time pinning down what you are doing, you have strayed from a
purpose.  That doesn't mean that random synaptic firings are bad,
just that they have no place here.

An advantage to this style, however, is that you don't need to know
what you are expert at until you become that expert.  The unique
writing atmosphere of the Internet  means that you and your readers and
will guide you there.   Once you have pinpointed
where you have a unique expertise, you can adapt what you write to
explore it at more depth.
