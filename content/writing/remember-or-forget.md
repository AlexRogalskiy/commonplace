title: Writing to remember, writing to forget
---
This weblog is an unpolished open notebook. It's primarily full of
two things: things I want to remember, and things I want to forget.
Let me explain.

A weblog is an augmented memory for those fleeting moments of life
where you really wish you had some record of, and where you know
that if you don't write it down now it'll be gone forever. It's the
capture place for that initial review of a piece of software you
might or might not grow fond of, the record of what was talked about
at a particularly interesting lunch meeting, or the color of a late
spring sky (grey, with low clouds; good strawberry picking weather
if the rain holds off, but not good for ripening the strawberries).
When you go back to reread what's been written down, some part of
the memories come back. If you're lucky and captured some particularly
salient point, the entire memory – the entire conversation – can
return and you'll be transported back to another time and place.

A weblog is also a place for the things that you figure out through
dogged attention to some terribly inconvenient detail of something
that's not working. When you figure it out, you want to write it
up so that you can repeat the process if it ever happens to you
again. You'd really rather never have to go through the ordeal again
but just in case someone else happens on it you'll have that capsule
of hard-won knowlege written down. You'll write it down so that you
can forget it except when you need to refer to it again, when you'll
relearn it as from new based on your old notes.

I'll cheat from time to time, going through old posts and updating
them with new information or with recollections that match the time.
Every so often I'll unpublish a piece that sounds like it doesn't
want to be something that I want to remember and that isn't forgotten
yet, or that has such atrocious grammar that I don't want to be
remembered by it. My drafts folder has over 200 such articles, ones
that neither qualified for remembering or for forgetting, but that
I can't easily bring myself to completely deleting.

Some blog to remember, some blog to forget (apologies to the Eagles).
