The [Computer and Video Game Archive] in the lower level (basement)
of the Art, Architecture and Engineering Library collects materials
relating to games. Visitors to the archive can use and play a wide
variety of games from the 1970s to the present. Twitter: [@umcvga].

The weblog is [Eaten by a Grue].

The archive is closed to the public during COVID, but the preservation
efforts (including digital backups) remain in progress.
