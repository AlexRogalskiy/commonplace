[Morgan and York](https://www.morganandyork.co/)
is the neighborhood deli. Good for
a bit of salami on your bagel. Newly equipped with
power outlets in front, and the wine selection
and a wine bar is opening in the back.

Note that Ricewood BBQ is out in the back parking lot
and serves from their truck six months of the year.

In mid 2019, Tommy York is doing a bunch of work on
the space, giving them a new kitchen.
