[Argus Farm Stop](http://www.argusfarmstop.com/)
has coffee, bread, and groceries on the
near Old West Side, Liberty at Second Street. Drink your
coffee in their glass greenhouse.

Argus has a second location at Packard
at Dewey, where Clague's Grocery was once upon a time.
Drink your coffee and buy vegetables right close to home.

Both Argus locations have beer and wine, and
carry a surprisingly wide variety of produce,
frozen meats, and packaged goods. For a snack,
get a pastry from Crust, or a hard boiled egg
or a wrapped sandwich.

Note that on Sundays the Amish goods will not be
available for sale.
