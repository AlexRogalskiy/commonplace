The nearby cafe to the house. Not a ton of seating, and the
prices are a little on the high side. But you can't argue with
the location, at Stadium and Packard where the Food and Drug Mart
used to be.

There's pricey gelato here too, and they serve an affogato.

My biggest beef with them is that the counter sometimes
forgets part of an order.
