Iced coffee, grande, with vanilla and milk: $2.92.
Open late (sometimes until midnight). Other than that,
it could be any Starbucks near any freeway anywhere
in the country.

There's a good view of the southern and eastern sky
across a busy Washtenaw / US-23 interchange. A patio
out front is surprisingly well-attended when the
weather is warm.

The big Arborland A sign marks the landmark.
