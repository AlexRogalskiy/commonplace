Elixir Vitae,
formerly known at Cafe Ambrosia, was a little cafe in the shadow
of the Maynard Street parking structure. It closed just before
the pandemic in late 2019 (good timing).

Order Ed's Blend if Ed is working, or Jimmy's Blend if Jimmy is working.

Ed coaches soccer and is a St. Louis Cardinals fan.

Jimmy doesn't like to work mornings.
