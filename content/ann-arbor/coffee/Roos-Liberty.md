[Roos Roast](https://roosroast.com/)
on Liberty is right downtown, the people are nice,
and it's always interesting to see John and Kath. The
spot is always very busy. Espresso and a boiled egg is only $3,
but it's easy to spend $7 if you fancy up the egg and put it
on toast and get a cortado and tip generously.
