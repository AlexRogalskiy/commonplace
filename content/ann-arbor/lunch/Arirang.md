Arirang has delicious Korean food on Oak Valley Drive,
south of town off of Ann Arbor Saline Road.

I've enjoyed the dolsot bi bim bap and the squid bi bim bap,
and generally the menu is excellent.

There are long tables, good for seating up to about a dozen
if you get there early enough to stake out the whole table.
