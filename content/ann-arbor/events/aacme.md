The Ann Arbor District Library and a2geeks have been hosting
AACME, the Ann Arbor Creativity and Maker Expo, at the downtown
library and adjacent plaza space. The event is typically in May.

This was previously the "Ann Arbor Mini Maker Faire", but the
event is no longer associated with the Maker Faire.
