There is a new DMR net that meets every Monday evening at 8pm local on
Talk Group 3126 (Michigan Statewide).  All are invited.

The [MichiganONE DMR Net](https://www.michiganonedmr.net/) shares
this mission statement:

> Welcome to the home of the MichiganONE DMR Net,
Michigan's first weekly DMR net hosted on the BrandMeister
Network. We are in the planning stages of this net, with a hope
to launch in April of 2019. This takes a great deal of coordination,
time and effort to successfully plan and launch an active and sustainable net.
