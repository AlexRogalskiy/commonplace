The N8DUY repeater on 145.15- is used for the Washtenaw County
Skywarn net during severe weather. It also hosts a weekly
ARPSC net on Sunday nights at 8:30 p.m. local time.

The repeater is located near the interchange of I-94
and M-14 in Scio Township. It reaches all of Washtenaw
County, and if conditions are favorable can be heard
as far south as Maumee, Ohio, and as far east as Pontiac,
Michigan.

You can also listen in via Broadcastify to a relay
of the signal, via [Washtenaw Skywarn].
