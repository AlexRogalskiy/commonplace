Spyserver is software for the Airspy series of
receivers that allows their SDRSharp software
to tune into remote receivers.

I've had good luck tuning in from remote, and
am testing a VPN setup with Tailscale that allows
me to connect to my home QTH and listen. A
narrowband channel needs a 140 kB/sec connection
to send the data necessary to grab a shortwave
signal; a perfectly good broadcast FM signal
will take almost 500 kB/sec for a stereo signal.
