KHEY 1380 in El Paso, TX used be picked up from the
[W5PIE] KiwiSDR (DM61tw) in that city. It appears that
a filter has been installed to attenuate AM signals,
and 1380 no longer has a legible signal there.

The station carries
the Texas Rangers.

The AAA El Paso Chihuahuas in the Pacific Coast League
are on ESPN El Paso 600 (KROD).
