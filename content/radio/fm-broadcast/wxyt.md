WXYT "The Ticket" is mostly noisy sports talk radio, but when the Tigers
are playing, they're the flagship FM station.

I can pick up 97.1 FM on my home SDR setup.
If you are looking for Tigers baseball and don't have a hardware
radio, try WTKA 1050 Ann Arbor.

Pick up WXYT on [Global Tuners](https://www.globaltuners.com/receiver/1460/js2)
Pontiac MI.
