Mostly noisy sports talk radio, but when the Tigers
are playing, they're the flagship FM station.

I can pick up 97.1 FM on my home SDR setup, but there
is not any current FM listening post nearby in its range.
If you are looking for Tigers baseball and don't have a hardware
radio, try WTKA 1050 Ann Arbor.
