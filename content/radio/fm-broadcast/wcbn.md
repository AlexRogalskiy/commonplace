[WCBN] is the student radio station at the University of Michigan.
88.3 FM all the way to the left on your dial.

A recent transmitter upgrade means that WCBN covers all of
Washtenaw County and portions of adjacent counties. When
you're on your next road trip, see how far you can go and
still pull in the signal!

An all-sports channel is available online, and carries
University of Michigan games with an all-student crew.
