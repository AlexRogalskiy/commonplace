"Entering or exiting through a doorway serves as an ‘event boundary’
in the mind, which separates episodes of activity and files them away,"
Radvansky explains.

"Recalling the decision or activity that was made in a different room
is difficult because it has been compartmentalized."

The study was published in the Quarterly Journal of Experimental
Psychology 64(8) as [Radvansky 2001].
