> A small win is a concrete, complete outcome of moderate importance.
By itself, one small win may seem unimportant. A series of small
wins at small but significant tasks, however, reveals a pattern
that may attract allies, deter opponents, and lower resistance to
subsequent proposals. A series of small wins is also more structurally
sound than a large win because small wins are stable building blocks.
Small wins are controllable opportunities that produce visible
results.  Once a small win has been accomplished, forces are set
in motion that favor another small win. When a solution is put into
place, the next solvable problem often becomes more visible.
Additional resources flow toward winners, which means that slightly
larger wins can be attempted.
