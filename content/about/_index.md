Ed is an Internet veteran with over 30 years experience.

He has extensive experience with networks at all levels - physical,
logical, technical, social, political, and financial.  He is a graduate
of the University of Michigan, and an alumnus of Cisco Systems and
Arbor Networks.

At Packet, Ed leads outreach to a wide variety of software ecosystems,
from open source to the Enterprise.   His main project is WorksOnARM,
which helps to bring cloud native and data center software to ARMv8
servers.

When he's not opening issues on Github, Ed can be found on the amateur
radio bands as W8EMV, tinkering with a pile of Raspberry Pis, or coworking
at Ann Arbor's Workantile.
