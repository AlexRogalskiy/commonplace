Anatomy of a Murder by Robert Traver (John Voelker) tells
the story of the "irresistable impulse" that leads to the
death of an Upper Peninsula bartender, and the murder trial
that follows. The book was a hit in 1958 and led to a film
shot on location in Marquette County the next year.

Voelker retired from the Michigan Supreme Court on the
royalties from the work, and spent the rest of his life fishing.
