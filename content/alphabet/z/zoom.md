[Zoom] is a popular video conferencing system, and a lot of
people are using it these days due to work from home.

The great drawback of Zoom is its uneven security model
which sometimes leads to unwanted callers, especially on
public calls.

Some alternatives to Zoom include [Jitsi], Google Meet,
Bluejeans, and Microsoft Teams. Each have their strengths
and drawbacks.
