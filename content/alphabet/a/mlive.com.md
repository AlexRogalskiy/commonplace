What's left of the [Ann Arbor News] newspaper is
mostly online, with a few stories a day focusing
on Ann Arbor boosterism and Ypsilanti crime,
plus lots and lots of sports photos from high
school sports around the state.

A 2019 story in the New York Times about the Michigan Daily, 
[When the student newspaper is the only newspaper],
was strenuously objected to by the few MLive reporters remaining.
