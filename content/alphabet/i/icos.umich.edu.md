ICOS, or the Interdisciplinary Committee on Organizational Studies, has the single goal of enhancing the University of Michigan's strength as a world center for interdisciplinary research and scholarship on organizations. We seek to enrich the intellectual environment of Ph.D. students and faculty interested in organization studies, by increasing the quality, breadth, depth, and usefulness of organizational research.

AKA the "Invisible College of Organizational Studies"

Lectures; Fridays at 1:30 pm at Ross.
