title: Intel, Qualcomm patents
---

Intel used the [40th anniversary of its x86 design] to
reaffirm its intention to protect its patent rights to
the ISA instruction set used in its computer chips. This
was widely interpreted by the tech press as a challenge
to Qualcomm, whose parternship with Microsoft includes a
just-in-time compiler for x86 capable of running Intel-based
Microsoft Windows user code at full speed. The
[roundup at Techmeme] is a good reference.

Neither Intel nor Qualcomm are strangers to the patent system,
with both of them measuring out year after year in the top 10
of patents issued. Intel's patents in computing server
technology are every bit as deep as Qualcomm's patents
in mobile technology.
