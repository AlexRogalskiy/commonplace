A case and network fabric suitable for building a computing
cluster out of these MACCHIATObin boards was announced at
launch time by [PicoCluster], which also makes cluster cases
for Raspberry Pi. The enclosure, which features space for
six of these compute boards, is sold in a variety of configurations
depending if you need just the case or if you are also buying
the compute boards and network gear.

"Shipping is expected to occur by the end of September 2017 subject
to board and switch availability."

ARM, ENEA, Marvell and PicoCluster all cooperated to produce a
the [NFV Picopod] version of this cluster, complete with a
full software stack that runs the OPNFV Danube software release for ARM.
This software and architecture is designed to be a lab-in-a-box
for developers of network functions virtualization (NFV) code.
