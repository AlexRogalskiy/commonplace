title: OpenSUSE on ARM hardware
---

[Andreas Färber] has an hour-long [presentation on OpenSUSE on ARM hardware],
in which he details the state of OpenSUSE on a whole
series of ARM development boards. The talk was presented at
the openSUSE Conference 2017 and published on May 27, 2017.
Andreas notes that this is "not a hardware selection guide",
and recommends that if you want ARM hardware recommendations
that you consult the [opensuse-arm mailing list] instead.

Andreas's hard work and others have resulted in OpenSUSE for
a number of systems, with more in progress, tracked on their
development wiki. Among those systems where OpenSUSE has some
good results include the 
[DragonBoard 410c],
[Firefly-RK3399] (in progress),
[Odroid C2],
[Pine64],
and [Raspberry Pi 3].

OpenSUSE also supports a [standard UEFI boot process], and
the provided instructions would enable you to PXE boot the
system.
