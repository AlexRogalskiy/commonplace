Apple announced a new ARM-powered iPad Pro at the WWDC. 
The device, a 10.5" or 12.9" tablet, is powered
by Apple's own A10X chip. [9to5Mac] and the
[BareFeats weblog] ran benchmarks on graphics and
CPU with the claim that 
and claimed that the new machine compares very
favorably to the 13" Macbook Pro.

From BareFeats, which is written by Rob Art Morgan:

> I am not implying that the iPad Pro can replace the MacBook Pro.

in capability. It's just encouraging to know that the iPad Pro
development has brought it up to laptop level performance.
