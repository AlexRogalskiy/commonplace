[Automotive Grade Linux] (AGL) is a Linux-based in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) platform aimed at OEMs who are looking for an open software stack for the connected car. AGL is a complete software stack including a Yocto-based board support package, automotive specific middleware for audio management, connection management, graphics, and a full application framework with App APIs and SDK. AGL also includes extensions to support the automotive CAN and MOST bus and a full security framework to make it reliable enough to put in vehicles.

This IVI platform was designed from the start to work
on ARM and Intel platforms equally well. In addition to the reference
platforms from Renesas, Intel, Qualcomm, NXP, TI, the system can run 
under emulation with QEMU or on community supported platforms
including the widely available [Raspberry Pi].
