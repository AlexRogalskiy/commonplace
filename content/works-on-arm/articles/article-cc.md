> From looking around the room, it was clear the workshop was
significantly more popular than expected. During the entire day,
there was standing room only, having throughout the day approximately
70 attendees. In spite of the crowded room, the audience stuck it
out to hear from early users of SVE simulators (University of
Michigan), application and runtime porters (BSC, AVL), ARM library
and Allinea tool designers, RIKEN, Cavium and the lead on the
Isambard project (University of Bristol).

The article was subsequently picked up by Hacker News, with
a measure of interesting discussion.
