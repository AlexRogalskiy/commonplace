---

Microsoft and Qualcomm have announced plans for an ARM based
Windows 10 device to be powered by the Snapdragon 835. The
system was demonstrated running Windows applications in an
emulation mode, and the report from [Tom's Hardware] of that 
demo talks of multiple Office documents, video, and email
running with no visible delays or hiccups.

Demos of the system have been out long out for the tech press
to start to speculate about how this system will fit into
the Windows ecosystem. [Tom's Hardware] has a long and thoughtful
but speculative piece based on reporting of the demos, calling
out the features of this new system and comparing it in
intended function to Google's Chromebook design.
