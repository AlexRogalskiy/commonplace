HHVM is a virtual machine for running PHP from Facebook.

HHVM is an open-source virtual machine designed for executing
programs written in Hack and PHP. HHVM uses a just-in-time (JIT)
compilation approach to achieve superior performance while maintaining
the development flexibility that PHP provides.

As of March 9, 2017, HHVM has been ported to the ARM environment.
