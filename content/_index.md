### Commonplace book

A commonplace book is a place to copy in things
that you want to keep close to you, rather than
necessarily original work. 

This is organized
two levels deep, one top level is the 
major level, the next one down is chapter
by chapter. This keeps individual sections
a reasonable size.

I got tired of the blog format, where
everything I wrote scrolled off the page.
This structure at least allows some 
chance that "old" things won't be totally lost.
