Some notes on music, artists and albums, mostly because I'm listening right now.

More about albums than individual tracks, since the music I grew up with
had albums as the primary way that artists made a statement.

Keep track of year of issue, so that I can understand how time
progresses.  Much of this music is on YouTube and Discogs so that
I can surf through albums I never managed to own myself.
