Makes a big pot of soup, but all proportions
are approximate depending on how much you have
and how much you want to make.

Before cooking, soak the white beans, perhaps
overnight. Or parboil them in plenty of boiling
water until just soft, about 45 minutes.
You might also use the instant pot, though I didn't.

In a big pot, saute onions, carrots, and celery.
Add half a can of tomato paste, stir until cooked.
Then add your beans in and enough water to cover.
Bring to a boil then simmer an hour or so.
Don't be afraid to add more water if the soup
gets too much like a stew.

Deb suggested to season with dill; one recipe
called for paprika.
