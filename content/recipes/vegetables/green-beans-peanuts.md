title: Green beans with peanuts
---

Serve with rice, which you should prepare first.

Fry garlic and ginger (lots of ginger) in oil.
Chop peanuts small in a food processor. Add them
to the ginger/garlic mixture. Cook until fragrant.

While the peanuts are cooking, trim a pound of
green beans and cut a package of savory baked
tofu into small cubes. 

Add the tofu to the peanut mixture and fry until
hot. Add lemon juice and some hot pepper flakes.

When the tofu/peanut mixture is hot and fragrant,
add the trimmed green beans. Cook until crisp-tender.
I added a little water to the pan and steamed them
with the sauce at the end.

Serve over rice, which should be ready just as the
green beans are ready.
