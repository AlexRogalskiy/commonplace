Figure out what the size of the input box is, and then fill it up with what you have to say so that everything you type fits without scrolling.\nIf your email client gives you ten lines to type your message, type ten (and not two or twenty). If letters to the editor have to be less than 500 words, never make it 600. If you crummy old cell phone has a tiny screen, learn to abbrev your memos to self.\nThis principle works as well for paper input methods. I am a recent convert from quadrille ruled 8.5x11\u0026rdquo; lab notebooks to a quad ruled pocket Moleskine notebook; it\u0026rsquo;s so much easier to fill up a page with one thought when the page only fits five long sentences vs. five long paragraphs.\nThe input box for the Vacuum wiki where I first wrote \u0026ldquo;Fill the input box without scrolling\u0026rdquo; is somewhat smaller than the Ecto input box, so I\u0026rsquo;m writing a little more - but not much.

	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "Here’s a thought experiment. Sit down in the morning with a cup of coffee and a list of topics. Work through them, one at a time, coming up with and writing down 500 words or so on each topic. How many topics do you get to over the course of the day, and how long does it take you to write 500 words that make sense? Assume for the sake of argument that there’s a typical number of distracting email, Twitter, and Facebook posts that you have to deal with. Each of the pieces that you are writing will need to contemplate a part of the net that might lead to its own distractions.\nI am always impressed by people who have the ability to sit down and crank out clean copy that is ready for publication. It’s not by any means easy to do this, and certainly every written work can be improved by judicious editing. I’m thinking more of the remarkable skill where you can type as fast as you can for a short burst and have the resulting words make sense, flow nicely, and be worth posting to the world.\nThe practice I get doing this has a lot to do with blogging, where I want to capture the moment and some momentarily interesting topic and put my mark on it. This is not writing a novel, and not writing a little piece of a 20-page or 400-page non-fiction work; rather, it’s somewhere between journalism and blogging. The work you are composing is temporarily interesting to a number of people in part because it has a good headline for Twitter and a body full of words that search engines like. You’ve written news, but it’s within the context of a blog, and because of that it’s perfectly acceptable to leave questions unanswered and stories unresolved. It’s what musician Michelle Shocked called the “incomplete image”, and perhaps you are waiting for someone with a longer deadline to write up the full story.\nI know from experience that I can put together 500 words in a sitting on one topic without taking a break and without needing to consult an outline. The much more challenging part is making a long, coherent single narrative out of these intermediate pieces parts. The skill of impromptu essay writing is by no means the same as the skill of book writing, and the task of challenging yourself to come up with a story that moves the current understanding a bit forward is a challenge.\nTo some degree, I’m willing to pad out those words with ample quotations from other sources, a sort of journalistic cut-and-paste that sifts through less well known sources to string together a story. (Of course the excerpts are carefully hyperlinked to avoid any suggestion of use without attribution.) Careful reuse of existing copy is one of the qualities that blogging can take advantage of that isn’t generally OK in journalism circles.\nIf all you wrote were impromptu essays for the net, you’d quickly find out what was a keeper by the traffic you were able to draw in. On a good day, I’m happy to write three or four blog posts that either satisfy my own interest in preserving a bit of news or that advance some larger story or that answer a question that’s on more than one person’s mind right now. That would translate into 2000 words on a good day, and that doesn’t sound like a lot. I think you’d have to work hard to keep the hopper full of article ideas and to keep up the research that fed a constant stream of ideas to work from, and to work doubly hard to collect the sort of essay-sized chunks that would eventually tell a story that’s longer and more carefully planned.\n(Inspired by #writechat on Sunday, 8 December 2013.)\n"

It can be expressed very simply:\n Write about a topic twice a day for six months and you will be recognized as an expert in that field.\n Hidden inside this simple method is a system for making it possible to sustain this output and to weave a set of connections (in your work and in the world) that go beyond a simple cut and paste of other people\u0026rsquo;s words and ideas.\n\u0026ndash;\nThis site puts these ideas into practice. It\u0026rsquo;s a demonstration of systematic and deliberate efforts to write with authority while still learning what there is to learn.\nYou can become expert simply by being persistent and methodical and public in your efforts to learn. Your site constructed for this purpose cannot be about anything and everything that comes to mind; as soon as someone describes it as eclectic or has a hard time pinning down what you are doing, you have strayed from a purpose. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that random synaptic firings are bad, just that they have no place here.\nAn advantage to this style, however, is that you don\u0026rsquo;t need to know what you are expert at until you become that expert. The unique writing atmosphere of the Internet means that you and your readers and will guide you there. Once you have pinpointed where you have a unique expertise, you can adapt what you write to explore it at more depth.\nOriginally written November 3, 2008, and edited July 5, 2017.\n"

	"content": "This weblog is an unpolished open notebook. It\u0026rsquo;s primarily full of two things: things I want to remember, and things I want to forget. Let me explain.\nA weblog is an augmented memory for those fleeting moments of life where you really wish you had some record of, and where you know that if you don\u0026rsquo;t write it down now it\u0026rsquo;ll be gone forever. It\u0026rsquo;s the capture place for that initial review of a piece of software you might or might not grow fond of, the record of what was talked about at a particularly interesting lunch meeting, or the color of a late spring sky (grey, with low clouds; good strawberry picking weather if the rain holds off, but not good for ripening the strawberries). When you go back to reread what\u0026rsquo;s been written down, some part of the memories come back. If you\u0026rsquo;re lucky and captured some particularly salient point, the entire memory – the entire conversation – can return and you\u0026rsquo;ll be transported back to another time and place.\nA weblog is also a place for the things that you figure out through dogged attention to some terribly inconvenient detail of something that\u0026rsquo;s not working. When you figure it out, you want to write it up so that you can repeat the process if it ever happens to you again. You\u0026rsquo;d really rather never have to go through the ordeal again but just in case someone else happens on it you\u0026rsquo;ll have that capsule of hard-won knowlege written down. You\u0026rsquo;ll write it down so that you can forget it except when you need to refer to it again, when you\u0026rsquo;ll relearn it as from new based on your old notes.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll cheat from time to time, going through old posts and updating them with new information or with recollections that match the time. Every so often I\u0026rsquo;ll unpublish a piece that sounds like it doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to be something that I want to remember and that isn\u0026rsquo;t forgotten yet, or that has such atrocious grammar that I don\u0026rsquo;t want to be remembered by it. My drafts folder has over 200 such articles, ones that neither qualified for remembering or for forgetting, but that I can\u0026rsquo;t easily bring myself to completely deleting.\nSome blog to remember, some blog to forget (apologies to the Eagles).\nThis entry was posted in Memory, Writing on June 10, 2013.\n"

This is an attempt to get unstuck.\nThe hardest part for me of working on assignments for someone else is the concern (justified or not) that the editor who is getting my work is going to be disappointed by it. I know that from past experience that’s unlikely to happen on this particular gig – not that they won’t see something to fix, but as long as it’s turned in on time and is the right shape and size I’ve had pretty good luck with getting the work approved.\nIt’s very different writing for someone else than it is for myself. Blogging has its own trials and travails, but pleasing an editor is not one of them. Rather, there’s a terrifying time when you hit “publish” and the world either sees your headline and says “meh” or they pick it up and share it with their friends.\nUltimately, most of my writing is for the world or for myself. I’ve written here before about keeping an open notebook and what that means for my tolerance for the incomplete image in my own writing. But when you’re writing for someone else the whole package really wants to be neat and tidy and polished, and that brings with it a separate set of expectations.\nThis entry was posted in Writing on September 27, 2013.\n"
